🫀 Heart Failure Prediction using Machine Learning

This project analyzes heart disease data and compares the performance of several machine learning models to predict the risk of heart failure. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, and the models are evaluated using accuracy, recall, and F1 score.

🎯 Goals
	•	Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Preprocess and clean the data
	•	Train and evaluate multiple classification models
	•	Compare results using standard evaluation metrics

🧪 Models Used
	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Support Vector Machine (SVM)
	•	Decision Tree
	•	Random Forest
	•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

📏 Evaluation Metrics
	•	Accuracy
	•	F1 Score
	•	Recall

📊 Dataset Overview
	•	No missing values
	•	Combination of categorical and numerical features
	•	Target variable: Presence of heart disease (binary)
