# 🫀 Heart Failure Prediction using Machine Learning

This project analyzes heart disease data and compares the performance of several machine learning models to predict the risk of heart failure. The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle**, and models are evaluated using **accuracy**, **recall**, and **F1 score**.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Preprocess and clean the data  
- Train and evaluate multiple **classification models**  
- Compare results using **standard evaluation metrics**  

---

## 🧪 Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  

---

## 📏 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy  
- F1 Score  
- Recall  

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- No missing values  
- Combination of **categorical** and **numerical** features  
- Target variable: **Presence of heart disease** (binary)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Place `heart.csv` in the same folder as the notebook  
2. Open and run all cells in `heart failure prediction.ipynb`  
3. View **EDA**, **model comparisons**, and **evaluation results**  

---

## ✅ Key Findings

- **Random Forest** and **SVM** performed best in most cases  
- Numerical features like **MaxHR** and **cholesterol** had strong influence  
- Proper preprocessing improved model accuracy  

---

## 🌱 Future Work
